        <p>Hello, all and welcome to my first website. Firstly, I would like to introduce myself. My name is Ramell Foster. I am 24 and I would like to pursue a career in software development. It may sound cliche but I have always been good with computer's since I was young so I have always been a little bit of a probelm solver. As a child I was really indepedent so I more or less figured out most things by myself which has really funelled into my adult life so naturally I prefer to figure things out myself. However, as I have grown aged I am concious of knowing when I should ask for help because I wont let my ego get the better of me. I'm quite keen to see how far I could potentially take this career path and hopefully end up on a DevOPS teams in the near future.   </p>
